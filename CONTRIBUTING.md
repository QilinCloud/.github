## How to contribute to Qilin.Cloud


#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Qilin.Cloud**, and instead refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/QilinCloud/QilinCloud/security).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching in GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/QilinCloud/QilinCloud/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/QilinCloud/QilinCloud/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**:
  * [**Connector** issues]()
  * [**Processor** issues]()


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Qilin.Cloud will generally not be accepted (read more about [our rationales behind this decision](https://github.com/QilinCloud/QilinCloud/wiki/Contributing#cosmetic-patch)).


#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [dicussions](https://github.com/orgs/QilinCloud/discussions) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.


#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Qilin.Cloud in the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/QilinCloud/discussions).


#### **Do you want to contribute to the Qilin.Cloud documentation?**

* We are always looking for volunteer documentation support. Please write us a mail: [development@qilin.cloud](mailto=development@qilin.cloud).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
